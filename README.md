# Paul Zavattieri's Portfolio

Welcome to the build site of my improved portfolio! If you were directed here from my prior portfolio, enhancements include:

- React.js will be the backbone of this portfolio
- SPA, much faster load times
- A more friendly UI/UX
- Clean, non-overwhelming transitions and animations
- Ability to filter through projects by tech
- Modals! For project info. I'm excited about this one if you couldn't tell.
- Maybe a game...not quite part of MVP but I have some ideas

## Target Completion

My goal is to have an MVP deployed by April 1, 2018.

## In the meantime...
